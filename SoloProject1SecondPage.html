    <p style="color: yellow; text-justify:distribute-all-lines;">Poe’s early stream-of-consciousness horror story, unreliable narrator and heart beating under the floorboards and
        all, is certainly one of the most adapted—and even more often referenced—short stories in popular culture, and
        which may or may not be the source for all of the hundreds of stories in which a character is tormented by a
        sound only they can hear. (Still not quite as ubiquitous as Poe himself, though . . .)</p>



    <p style="color:chartreuse;">
        I agonized over whether I should pick “Rip Van Winkle” or “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow” from Irving’s oeuvre.
        Both have many, many adaptations to their name and are so ubiquitous as to have drifted into the folklore realm.
        The latter certainly has more memorable recent adaptations, but the former is the only one with a bridge named
        after it. Ah, screw it, we’ll count them both.
